== My home directory

Some configuration files I store in my home directory.  I often work in Ubuntu, RHEL, and Solaris, but ocassionally have to work in other un*xes.

To use this:

{{{
./setup.pl
}}}

It outputs a report of problems that it sees, where existing files prevent the global settings from taking effect.

== Machine-specific overrides

In some cases, I want to have local settings, specific to a machine, that override my global settings.

Whenever a file allows for 'source' or '#include' functionality, then the eg. ~/.bashrc can be a real file (instead of a symlink to ~/dotfiles/.bashrc), and can make changes before and after the line that sources ~/dotfiles/.bashrc.

Setup.pl knows about each file type, and will suggest the appropriate 'source'/'#include' line, whenever it notices a conflict with an existing local file.

== Shared root

I manage several boxes where multiple people have access to root.  To avoid stepping on each other's toes, I have set up root's ~/.bashrc so it loads a ~/.sudo_bashrc from the original user's home directory, if it exists.  This applies to ~/.sudo_vimrc as well.

The exact mechanism for doing this isn't trivial, but it's good to know it's there, because this feature shows up in a lot of other random files here.
