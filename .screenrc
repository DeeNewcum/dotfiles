## TODO:
## 
## I want to have:
##      1. the hardstatus (the very bottom line) display the current directory
##      2. the window title (which displays in my local terminal emulator) display the server name
## Unfortunately, the ANSI escape sequences
##          '\e]0;'$HOSTNAME'\007'    and
##          '\e_'$HOSTNAME'\e\\'
## seem to update both. This is not what I want to happen. Ther MUST be a way to update them
## separately, since the GNU Screen manual, in the "String Escapes" section, uses %h for the
## hardstatus string, and %t for the window title, so they must be separate things at some level,
## no?
##
## Possible solutions:
##
##      * SecureCRT has an option "Ignore window title change requests option", which means that I
##        I could set the tab's title manually.
##
## Things to note:
##
##      * I believe I got this working on the server 'toolkit', but those same settings failed to
##        work properly on my webserver. Why, I don't know.
##              https://github.com/DeeNewcum/dotfiles/commit/2ac6e79d74ec5a516b005e5d61e2375e1d0fb8be
##
##      * I don't understand the manual's section called "Dynamic Titles", but there ARE .screenrc
##        settings named 'defdynamictitle' and 'dynamictitle'. Maybe those could help?
