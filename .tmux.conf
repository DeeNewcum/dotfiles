    ## You really want to use tmux 1.5+.  v1.5 included a change that makes scrolling through
    ## history with the mouse-wheel much easier:
    ##      When mode-mouse is on, automatically enter copy mode when the mouse is dragged or the
    ##      mouse wheel is used. Also exit copy mode when the mouse wheel is scrolled off the
    ##      bottom.
