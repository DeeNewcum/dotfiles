## Yet another dotfile repository ##

    $  git clone https://github.com/DeeNewcum/dotfiles.git
    $  cd dotfiles
    $  ./deedot
    $  ls -l ~/.bashrc
    ~/.bashrc -> ~/dotfiles/.bashrc

    # Your dotfiles are safe.  DeeDot won't overwrite anything.

This is my personal dotfile repo.  There are [many like it](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=dotfiles&repo=&langOverride=&start_value=1&type=Repositories&language=), but this one is mine.

## [DeeDot](https://github.com/DeeNewcum/deedot) ##

DeeDot is a script I wrote that installs/maintains the symlinks, and it's well-documented [over there](https://github.com/DeeNewcum/deedot).

## Shared root ##

I manage boxes where several people have access to root.  To avoid stepping on each other other's toes, I have [set up root's ~/.bashrc](https://github.com/DeeNewcum/dotfiles/blob/master/.sudo_bashrc#L3-5) so that it loads a ~/.sudo_bashrc from the original user's home directory. 

My own ~/.sudo_bashrc will pull in a variety of other .rc settings from the original home directory, including ~/.vimrc, ~/.inputrc, ~/.less, ~/.ackrc, and ~/.perltidyrc.

## My background ##

I use five unix boxes on a daily basis, so checking in my dotfiles saves me a lot of time.

I often work in Ubuntu, RHEL, and Solaris.  And that's Solaris 9, on boxes I don't control so I can't install a modern GNU toolset, so there are various tricks here to coerce Solaris 9 to behave in similar ways to modern OS's.
