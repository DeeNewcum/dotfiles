! Swap caps lock and escape.  This saves SOOO much time for vi.
! 
! To manually load this:
!       xmodmap ~/.xmodmap
!
! In Gnome 3 (Ubuntu 13.10+), it's better to use XKB instead of Xmodmap.  Run this at the command line, once:
!       dconf write /org/gnome/desktop/input-sources/xkb-options "['caps:escape']"                           
! If you continue trying to use xmodmap, your settings will get reset periodically, as a result of
! the keyboard layout indicator:

!
! In XFCE4, you'll need to do this to make sure xmodmap gets loaded  (tested on Ubuntu 13.10):
!       1. Applications Menu > Settings > Session and Startup > Application Autostart
!       2. Add
!       3. fill this in:
!               name --         xmodmap
!               description --  <blank>
!               command --      sleep 2; /usr/bin/xmodmap $HOME/.Xmodmap
!       ^^
!       ^^ damn, that only works temporarily too....  if you plug/unplug a keyboard, you lose it

remove Lock = Caps_Lock
keysym Escape = Caps_Lock
keysym Caps_Lock = Escape
add Lock = Caps_Lock
