#!/bin/bash

# This is a script that gets launched directly in response to some keyboard shortcut.
# It launches dmenu  (by way of pydmenu.py).
#
# To modify the keyboard shortcuts in Ubuntu 12.04, run:
#       gnome-control-center keyboard
#
# In Ubuntu 10.10, run:
#       gnome-keybinding-properties

# without this, aliases won't work in dmenu
shopt -s expand_aliases     # allow alias expansion in non-interactive shells

[ -f ~/.bash_aliases ] && source ~/.bash_aliases

cmdline=$(~/apps/bin/pydmenu.py)
echo $cmdline   >  /tmp/$USER.dmenu
eval "$cmdline" >> /tmp/$USER.dmenu 2>&1

    # Sometimes aliases and other commands don't work...
    # All output (including errors) is logged to /tmp/$USER.dmenu, to help you dianose the problem.
