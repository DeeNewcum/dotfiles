The files here are meant to be hooked into the browser in some way.

While they can easily be hosted on one of my websites, it's sometimes better to host a copy of these locally — either for speed, or because I want them available even when the internet is inaccessible.

The way that each gets hooked into the browser varies.  In many cases, they require a little manual setup.  See each file for details.

## Files

* [js_search_bar.html](https://rawgit.com/DeeNewcum/dotfiles/master/browser/js_search_bar.html) — Provides several auto-configured keymarks.  It also provides a little extra syntactic sugar on top of normal keymark functionality.
* [homepage_media_center.html](https://rawgit.com/DeeNewcum/dotfiles/master/browser/homepage_media_center.html) — A homepage that I use on computers that are sometimes used as media centers.
* Greasemonkey — plugins that provide various functionality
  * [work_obscure_facebook.user.js](https://github.com/DeeNewcum/dotfiles/blob/master/browser/greasemonkey/work_obscure_facebook.user.js) — Stylesheet that makes Facebook look less flashy and more like technical documentation.  (could be re-implemented to work with [Stylish](https://userstyles.org/help) intead)
