# adds all of the remote branches as tracked branches

# I've seen this proposed as one way to add all branches as tracked:
#       for remote in `git branch -r`; do git branch --track ${remote#origin/} $remote; done
# However, that doesn't work on my local machine.


# TODO: these are possible ways to list the branches on a remote repo:
#   git branch -r
#   git remote show
#   git ls-remote
