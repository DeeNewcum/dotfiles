# diff is called by git with 7 parameters:
# 1 = path
# 2 = old-file
# 3 = old-hex
# 4 = old-mode
# 5 = new-file
# 6 = new-hex
# 7 = new-mode

# Note -- Sometimes 'git diff' generates a long sequence of vimdiff calls. If
#         you have looked at all the diffs you want to, halfway through, you can
#         run :cq, which tells Vim to quit with a non-zero exit code. This
#         non-zero exit code signals to 'git' to stop calling
#         $GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF.
exec vimdiff -c "setlocal buftype=nofile bufhidden=hide noswapfile" -R "$2" "$5"
exit
