All third-party applications go here.  Specific directories:

* ~/apps/ebuild/ — ebuild-like scripts, that will download, compile, and install everything in one go
* ~/apps/build/ — where source is compiled into binaries
* ~/apps/stow/ — the $PREFIX for installed packages,so they can be managed by [GNU stow](http://www.inductiveload.com/posts/basic-use-of-gnu-stowxstow/)
