Okay, these aren't literally ebuild/PKGBUILD/etc scripts, but they're something in the same vein.

These scripts will download and compile various things from source for me, and configure them the
way I want.

They ultimately dump the binaries in ~/apps/bin/.

These scripts may eventually become more like proper ebuild/pkgbuild scripts, but for now, they're
hard-coded.
