These are similar to, but not literally the same as:

* [Brew Formulas](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/Formula-Cookbook) ([lots of examples](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/tree/master/Library/Formula/))
* [ebuild](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebuild)
* [PKGBUILD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_Linux#Arch_User_Repository)

These scripts will download and compile various things from source for me, and configure them the way I want.

They ultimately dump the binaries in ~/apps/stow/.

These scripts may eventually become more like proper ebuild/pkgbuild scripts, but for now, they're fairly immature and hard-coded.
