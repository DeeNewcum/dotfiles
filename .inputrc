################################[ tab completion ]###################################

# Be more intelligent when autocompleting by also looking at the text after
# the cursor. For example, when the current line is "cd ~/src/mozil", and
# the cursor is on the "z", pressing Tab will not autocomplete it to "cd
# ~/src/mozillail", but to "cd ~/src/mozilla". (This is supported by the
# Readline used by Bash 4.)

# immediately add a trailing slash when autocompleting symlinks to directories

#######################[ showing all possible completions ]###################################

# require only a single-tab key instead of tab+tab to produce a list of all possible completions when:
#       - when a partial completion is possible, or
#       - when no completion is possible
set show-all-if-ambiguous on

# show file types when listing file matches, like 'ls -F' does

# donâ€™t prompt unless there are over 500 possible completions
